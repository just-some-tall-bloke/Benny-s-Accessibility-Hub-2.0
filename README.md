# Benny's Accessibility Hub 2.0

**A bespoke software suite for one- and two-switch accessibility, built with Electron.**

This project provides an accessible computing environment designed for users who operate a computer with limited input methods (such as a single switch). The hub includes games, communication tools, journaling, media streaming control, and more — all navigable via switch scanning.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This software was created by caregivers for a specific individual with TUBB4A-related Leukodystrophy (H-ABC). It is **not** professional medical software.

This repository serves as an open-source example of how families can use modern development tools (including AI-assisted workflows like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot) to build accessible technology tailored to specific needs.

---

## Architecture

The system is built on **Electron** (Node.js + Chromium) with specific Python components for features that require system-level access.

### Core (Electron / Node.js)

* `main.js` — Electron main process, launches the hub
* `preload.js` — Secure bridge between web pages and Node.js
* `bennyshub/` — All HTML/CSS/JS applications (games, tools, hub interface)

### Python Components (Windows-specific)

These run as separate processes when needed:

* `messenger/ben_discord_app.py` — Discord GUI client with switch-accessible interface
* `messenger/simple_dm_listener.py` — Background service announcing incoming DMs via TTS
* `search/narbe_scan_browser.py` — Web search with accessible scanning interface
* `streaming/server.py` — Local server for streaming app control
* `streaming/utils/control_bar.py` — Always-on-top overlay for controlling streaming apps
